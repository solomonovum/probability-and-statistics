## Hypothesis Testing Process
#### step 1 : Set the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
#### step 2 : Draw the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis and identify the sampling mean. (CLT)
#### step 3 : The critical value(threshold) is determined according to the two-sided test or one-sided test.
#### step 4 : Check if the test statistic(z) is in the rejection region.

#### Two-tailed tests : u1 = u2 or not
#### One-tailed tests : u1 < u2 or u1 > u2

#### [Statistical significance]


## Definition of terms
#### null hypothesis (H0) : A hypothesis associated with a contradiction to a theory one would like to prove.
#### alternative hypothesis (H1) : A hypothesis (often composite) associated with a theory one would like to prove.
#### test statistic : 
#### acceptance region : The set of values of the test statistic for which we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
#### rejection region : The set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is rejected.
#### critical value : The threshold value delimiting the regions of acceptance and rejection for the test statistic.
#### level of significance : It is the upper bound imposed on the size of a test. Testing H0 at significance level α means testing H0 with a test whose size does not exceed α. [The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5% or much lower—depending on the field of study.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance)
#### p-value : The probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic.

## Type-I Error
: Type-I error occurs when the sample results, lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. 
Type-I errors are equivalent to false positives. ype-I errors can be controlled. The value of alpha, which is related to the level of Significance that we selected has a direct bearing on Type-I errors.

## Type-II Error
: Type-II error occurs when based on the sample results, the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is in fact false. 
Type-II errors are equivalent to false negatives.

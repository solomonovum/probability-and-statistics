## Continuous Probability Variable & Probability Distribution

### [1. Continuous Probability Variable](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/statsreview/continuous-probability-distributions/)
: A probability variable in which the X(Real Number) can take on any value (is continuous) between a section.

### [2. Probability Density Function](https://www.math24.net/probability-density-function/)
: A statistical expression that defines a probability distribution (the likelihood of an outcome) for a discrete random variable (e.g., a stock or ETF) as opposed to a continuous random variable. It has three properties that can be referenced in the link.

### [4. Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
: A type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. Many other distributions are bell-shaped. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem.

#### [Central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) 
: When independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

### [5. Standard Normal Distribution](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=standard_normal_distribution)
: A special case of the normal distribution . It is the distribution that occurs when a normal random variable has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Z = (X - μ)/σ

#### Bernstein's theorem
: if X and Y are independent and X+Y and X-Y (linear combination) are also independent, then both X and Y must necessarily have normal distributions.

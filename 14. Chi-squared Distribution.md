## Chi-squared Distribution

### Pearson's chi-squared test[(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test)

#### definition
a statistical test applied to sets of categorical or qualitative data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance.

used to assess three types of comparison: goodness of fit, homogeneity, and independence.

#### Assumptions
##### Expected cell count
Adequate expected cell counts. Some require 5 or more, and others require 10 or more. A common rule is 5 or more in all cells of a 2-by-2 table, and 5 or more in 80% of cells in larger tables, but no cells with zero expected count.
##### Independence
The observations are always assumed to be independent of each other. This means chi-squared cannot be used to test correlated data (like matched pairs or panel data).

#### test of independence
: df = (Rows − 1)×(Cols − 1), where in this case, Rows corresponds to number of categories in one variable, and Cols corresponds to number of categories in the second variable

#### test of goodness-of-fit
: df = Cats − Parms, where Cats is the number of observation categories recognized by the model, and Parms is the number of parameters in the model adjusted to make the model best fit the observations: The number of categories reduced by the number of fitted parameters in the distribution.

#### test of homogeneity
: df = (Rows − 1)×(Cols − 1), where Rows corresponds to the number of categories (i.e. rows in the associated contingency table), and Cols corresponds the number of independent groups (i.e. columns in the associated contingency table).
